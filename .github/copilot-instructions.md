# Coding Style

## Immutability (CRITICAL)

ALWAYS create new objects, NEVER mutate existing ones:

```
// Pseudocode
WRONG:  modify(original, field, value) → changes original in-place
CORRECT: update(original, field, value) → returns new copy with change
```

Rationale: Immutable data prevents hidden side effects, makes debugging easier, and enables safe concurrency.

## File Organization

MANY SMALL FILES > FEW LARGE FILES:
- High cohesion, low coupling
- 200-400 lines typical, 800 max
- Extract utilities from large modules
- Organize by feature/domain, not by type

## Error Handling

ALWAYS handle errors comprehensively:
- Handle errors explicitly at every level
- Provide user-friendly error messages in UI-facing code
- Log detailed error context on the server side
- Never silently swallow errors

## Input Validation

ALWAYS validate at system boundaries:
- Validate all user input before processing
- Use schema-based validation where available
- Fail fast with clear error messages
- Never trust external data (API responses, user input, file content)

## Code Quality Checklist

Before marking work complete:
- [ ] Code is readable and well-named
- [ ] Functions are small (<50 lines)
- [ ] Files are focused (<800 lines)
- [ ] No deep nesting (>4 levels)
- [ ] Proper error handling
- [ ] No hardcoded values (use constants or config)
- [ ] No mutation (immutable patterns used)

# Testing Requirements

## Minimum Test Coverage: 80%

Test Types (ALL required):
1. **Unit Tests** - Individual functions, utilities, components
2. **Integration Tests** - API endpoints, database operations
3. **E2E Tests** - Critical user flows (framework chosen per language)

## Test-Driven Development

MANDATORY workflow:
1. Write test first (RED)
2. Run test - it should FAIL
3. Write minimal implementation (GREEN)
4. Run test - it should PASS
5. Refactor (IMPROVE)
6. Verify coverage (80%+)

## Troubleshooting Test Failures

1. Use **tdd-guide** agent
2. Check test isolation
3. Verify mocks are correct
4. Fix implementation, not tests (unless tests are wrong)

## Agent Support

- **tdd-guide** - Use PROACTIVELY for new features, enforces write-tests-first

## Source: git-workflow.md

# Git Workflow

## Commit Message Format

```
<type>: <description>

<optional body>
```

Types: feat, fix, refactor, docs, test, chore, perf, ci

Note: Configure attribution and AI preferences in VS Code settings if needed.

## Pull Request Workflow

When creating PRs:
1. Analyze full commit history (not just latest commit)
2. Use `git diff [base-branch]...HEAD` to see all changes
3. Draft comprehensive PR summary
4. Include test plan with TODOs
5. Push with `-u` flag if new branch

## Feature Implementation Workflow

1. **Plan First**
   - Use **planner** agent to create implementation plan
   - Identify dependencies and risks
   - Break down into phases

2. **TDD Approach**
   - Use **tdd-guide** agent
   - Write tests first (RED)
   - Implement to pass tests (GREEN)
   - Refactor (IMPROVE)
   - Verify 80%+ coverage

3. **Code Review**
   - Use **code-reviewer** agent immediately after writing code
   - Address CRITICAL and HIGH issues
   - Fix MEDIUM issues when possible

4. **Commit & Push**
   - Detailed commit messages
   - Follow conventional commits format

# Performance Optimization

## Model Usage Strategy

- Use a faster model for lightweight edits, formatting, and straightforward refactors
- Use a stronger model for architecture, complex debugging, and deep reviews
- Prefer the currently selected VS Code Copilot model unless task complexity requires switching

## Context Window Management

Avoid last 20% of context window for:
- Large-scale refactoring
- Feature implementation spanning multiple files
- Debugging complex interactions

Lower context sensitivity tasks:
- Single-file edits
- Independent utility creation
- Documentation updates
- Simple bug fixes

## Complex Task Workflow

For complex tasks requiring deep reasoning:
1. Build a short plan first
2. Break work into verifiable milestones
3. Use focused subagents where it improves parallelism or isolation
4. Verify results after each milestone

## Build Troubleshooting

If build fails:
1. Use **build-error-resolver** agent
2. Analyze error messages
3. Fix incrementally
4. Verify after each fix

# Common Patterns

## Skeleton Projects

When implementing new functionality:
1. Search for battle-tested skeleton projects
2. Use parallel agents to evaluate options:
   - Security assessment
   - Extensibility analysis
   - Relevance scoring
   - Implementation planning
3. Clone best match as foundation
4. Iterate within proven structure

## Design Patterns

### Repository Pattern

Encapsulate data access behind a consistent interface:
- Define standard operations: findAll, findById, create, update, delete
- Concrete implementations handle storage details (database, API, file, etc.)
- Business logic depends on the abstract interface, not the storage mechanism
- Enables easy swapping of data sources and simplifies testing with mocks

### API Response Format

Use a consistent envelope for all API responses:
- Include a success/status indicator
- Include the data payload (nullable on error)
- Include an error message field (nullable on success)
- Include metadata for paginated responses (total, page, limit)

# Security Guidelines

## Mandatory Security Checks

Before ANY commit:
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets (API keys, passwords, tokens)
- [ ] All user inputs validated
- [ ] SQL injection prevention (parameterized queries)
- [ ] XSS prevention (sanitized HTML)
- [ ] CSRF protection enabled
- [ ] Authentication/authorization verified
- [ ] Rate limiting on all endpoints
- [ ] Error messages don't leak sensitive data

## Secret Management

- NEVER hardcode secrets in source code
- ALWAYS use environment variables or a secret manager
- Validate that required secrets are present at startup
- Rotate any secrets that may have been exposed

## Security Response Protocol

If security issue found:
1. STOP immediately
2. Use **security-reviewer** agent
3. Fix CRITICAL issues before continuing
4. Rotate any exposed secrets
5. Review entire codebase for similar issues

# Agent Orchestration

## Available Agents

Located in `.github/agents/` (workspace) or user profile custom agents:

| Agent | Purpose | When to Use |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| planner | Implementation planning | Complex features, refactoring |
| architect | System design | Architectural decisions |
| tdd-guide | Test-driven development | New features, bug fixes |
| code-reviewer | Code review | After writing code |
| security-reviewer | Security analysis | Before commits |
| build-error-resolver | Fix build errors | When build fails |
| e2e-runner | E2E testing | Critical user flows |
| refactor-cleaner | Dead code cleanup | Code maintenance |
| doc-updater | Documentation | Updating docs |

## Immediate Agent Usage

No user prompt needed:
1. Complex feature requests - Use **planner** agent
2. Code just written/modified - Use **code-reviewer** agent
3. Bug fix or new feature - Use **tdd-guide** agent
4. Architectural decision - Use **architect** agent

## Parallel Task Execution

ALWAYS use parallel Task execution for independent operations:

```markdown
# GOOD: Parallel execution
Launch 3 agents in parallel:
1. Agent 1: Security analysis of auth module
2. Agent 2: Performance review of cache system
3. Agent 3: Type checking of utilities

# BAD: Sequential when unnecessary
First agent 1, then agent 2, then agent 3
```

## Multi-Perspective Analysis

For complex problems, use split role sub-agents:
- Factual reviewer
- Senior engineer
- Security expert
- Consistency reviewer
- Redundancy checker

## Source: hooks.md

# Hooks System

## Hook Events

Use VS Code Copilot hook lifecycle events:
- `SessionStart`
- `UserPromptSubmit`
- `PreToolUse`
- `PostToolUse`
- `PreCompact`
- `SubagentStart`
- `SubagentStop`
- `Stop`

## Hook Practices

- Keep hooks deterministic and fast
- Validate and sanitize all hook input
- Use non-blocking behavior unless policy enforcement is required
- Keep hook scripts in version control and review them like application code

## Approval Safety

Use auto-approval cautiously:
- Enable only for trusted workflows
- Disable for exploratory or high-risk operations
- Review tool permissions regularly
